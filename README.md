### 3. Instruction

##### **3.1 Instructions on How To Use the plugin** 

1. Type the Bible Address. E.g: John 3:16. Then select them.

2. Click Bible for Wordpress Button on the WP Editor Toolbar. You should see [bible]John 3:16[/bible]

##### **3.2 Example:**

In the text editor, type: `Hi, my name is Scott and [bible]John 3:16[/bible] is my favorite verse.`

When you publish the post or page, it will look like: *Hi, my name is Scott and [John 3:16](https://www.bible.com/bible/151/john.3.16 "John 3:16") is my favorite verse.*

Remember to spell the verse reference properly and use the commonly accepted format for Bible references (ie. John 3:16). The reference formats that work are "John 3:16" and "John 3:16-18".

References that use commas (ie. John 3:16,18) or multi-chapter spans (ie. John 3:16-4:5) will not work and will result in a link that leads to a dead page on [Bible.com](https://bible.com/ "Bible.com").

##### **3.3 More information:**

You can also use abbreviation name for book name. Ex: `Gen` ~ `Genesis`. Please view all supported name in Plugin Settings Page.

Because of many bible versions, plugins support quick search bible version you want using [Select2](https://select2.github.io "Select2").

If you use only specific versions, you can customize plugin for your site.
